# Q-learning Car                                          

About the Project - 
--------------------
This project uses a car simulator mainly for visual-based lane keeping/centering task. 
A Q-learning method and a Deep Q-learning (with MLP) method are introdused to solve the user-defined task.

DNN -
--------------------
For the deep network part, pytoch is applied for the realization.
